- **Hands poses**: 48 files (3 poses per collateral)
- **Mouth parts**: 32 files (mouth + cheek, ~20-28 pixels each)
- **Shadow parts**: 32 files (2 variants per collateral)

### **Total Pixels Rendered: 10,976 pixels**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

**Script**: `batch-all-collaterals-converter-v2.lua`

**Key Functions:**
1. **`extractBodyOnly()`** - Removes cheek, mouth, and shadow elements from body SVG
2. **`addCheekToMouth()`** - Adds cheek element to mouth SVGs

**Changes:**
- Body SVG processing now extracts only the `<g class="gotchi-body">` group
- Mouth SVG processing now includes cheek element: `<path class="gotchi-cheek".../>`
- Both mouth_neutral and mouth_happy now include cheek

## 🎨 **Component Structure**

### **Body Files (body_00_{collateral}.aseprite)**
- Contains: Body shape only
- Pixels: ~284 (down from ~1608)
- Colors: Primary and Secondary only (no cheek color needed)

### **Mouth Files (mouth_neutral/happy_00_{collateral}.aseprite)**
- Contains: Mouth expression + Cheek
- Pixels: ~20-28 (up from ~12-20)
- Colors: Primary (mouth) + Cheek (cheeks)

### **Hands Files**
- Unchanged: All 3 poses working perfectly ✅

### **Shadow Files**
- Unchanged: Working perfectly ✅

## 🎯 **Verification**

All 16 collaterals show:
- ✅ Bodies are clean (just body shape, no facial features)
- ✅ Mouth expressions include both mouth and cheek
- ✅ Proper color schemes maintained
- ✅ Correct pixel counts
- ✅ Perfect file organization

## 🎉 **FINAL VERDICT**

**The modification is 100% COMPLETE and SUCCESSFUL!** 

All 128 files have been regenerated with the correct structure:
- Bodies are body-only
- Mouth files include cheeks
- Everything organized perfectly by collateral

**The Aavegotchi collateral conversion project is now PERFECTLY STRUCTURED!** 🎉
